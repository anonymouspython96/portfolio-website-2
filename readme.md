Key Features: Responsive navbar, image carousel, newsletter modal.

Documentation: AuraLens Landing Page
This documentation provides an overview of the structure, features, and technologies used to build the AuraLens landing page, a single-page interactive web application (SPA).

1. Project Overview
The AuraLens landing page is designed to showcase an imaginary product: smart augmented reality glasses. The primary goal is to guide the user through a clear and engaging experience, from initial product discovery to the final call to action for pre-ordering or signing up for a newsletter. The entire website is contained within a single HTML file for maximum portability and ease of use.

2. Architecture and Technologies
HTML5: Provides the semantic structure for all page content.

Tailwind CSS: Used for a fully responsive, modern layout and styling. The framework is loaded via CDN, ensuring a lightweight and efficient implementation.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Manages all interactive logic, including the mobile navigation toggle, the image carousel, and the newsletter sign-up modal. No external JavaScript libraries were used for these functionalities.

Google Fonts: The 'Inter' font is used for clean, professional typography and is loaded from Google Fonts.

3. Page Structure
The page is organized into several key sections to guide visitors through a logical flow:

Hero Section: The initial view, designed to grab attention with a compelling headline and a clear call to action (CTA).

Features Section: Presents the product's key benefits in an easy-to-scan grid layout, using simple Unicode characters as icons for quick recognition.

Image Gallery (Carousel): An interactive section that showcases multiple views of the product. The carousel automatically cycles through images, but users can also navigate manually using the control buttons.

Pricing Section: Displays the product's purchase options (Explorer and Pro Editions) in a card format, with the recommended plan highlighted to encourage conversion.

Newsletter Modal: A pop-up that appears over the main page to collect user emails, providing a non-intrusive way to capture leads.

Footer: Contains contact information and social media links.

4. Interactive Features
Mobile Navigation: The navigation menu transforms into a mobile-friendly hamburger menu on smaller devices, improving usability on phones and tablets.

Image Carousel: The gallery section features an image carousel that automatically advances every 5 seconds. Users can also manually navigate back and forth using the arrow buttons.

Newsletter Modal: Users can open a pop-up modal by clicking the "Join Newsletter" button. The modal includes a form for email submission and can be closed by clicking the "X" button or the overlay outside the window.

Smooth Scroll: The scroll-behavior: smooth CSS property is used to ensure a fluid transition between sections when users click on navigation links, providing a more elegant user experience than an instant jump.

5. How to Modify or Expand
Customizing the Style: Edit Tailwind classes directly in the HTML to change colors, spacing, and the overall layout. The chosen color palette is "Cool Gray and Mint," but you can easily replace it.

Adding New Sections: Insert new HTML sections within the <main> tag. Make sure to give each section a unique ID (e.g., <section id="new-section">) and add a corresponding link to the navigation bar.

Adding Functionality: For new interactions, write the necessary JavaScript code within the existing <script> tag. For instance, you could add a customer reviews section or a product demo video.
